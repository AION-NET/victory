##   RateLimitModule.py

This module provides basic rate-limiting functionality for the AION RWX API. It uses an in-memory implementation, which is **not suitable for production environments**. This module is intended as a placeholder and should be replaced with a more robust and scalable solution for production deployments.

**Code Explanation:**

* **Configuration:**
    * `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED`: A boolean flag to enable or disable rate limiting.
    * `RATE_WINDOW`: The time window (in seconds) within which requests are counted.
    * `RATE_MAX_REQUESTS`: The maximum number of allowed requests within the defined time window.
* **`REQUEST_HISTORY` Dictionary:**
    * This is a dictionary that stores the request history for each client (identified by IP address).
    * For each client IP, it maintains a list of timestamps representing the times of their requests.
    * **Important:** This in-memory storage is only suitable for development and testing. It will not persist across server restarts and is not scalable for multiple concurrent users.
* **`setup_rate_limiting(app: FastAPI)` Function:**
    * This function sets up the rate-limiting middleware for the FastAPI application.
    * It defines an `@app.middleware("http")` that will be executed for every incoming HTTP request.
    * Inside the middleware:
        * It retrieves the client's IP address using `request.client.host`.
        * If `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` is True, it calls the `check_rate_limit()` function to enforce the rate limit.
        * It then proceeds to process the request using `call_next(request)`.
* **`check_rate_limit(client_ip: str)` Function:**
    * This function performs the actual rate limit check.
    * It retrieves the request history for the given `client_ip` from the `REQUEST_HISTORY` dictionary.
    * It removes any timestamps from the history that are older than the current time minus the `RATE_WINDOW`.
    * If the number of remaining requests in the history is greater than or equal to `RATE_MAX_REQUESTS`, it raises an `HTTPException` with a 429 Too Many Requests status code.
    * Finally, it adds the current timestamp to the request history for the `client_ip`.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Production Use:** The in-memory rate limiting implemented in this module is **not suitable for production**. It is not persistent, scalable, or thread-safe.
* **Alternative Solutions:** For production environments, consider using more robust and persistent rate-limiting solutions such as:
    * **Redis:** A popular in-memory data store that can be used for persistent and distributed rate limiting.
    * **Leaky Bucket/Token Bucket Algorithms:** Implement these algorithms using appropriate libraries or data structures.
    * **FastAPI's `SlowAPI`:** A FastAPI extension that provides rate limiting capabilities.
* **Client Identification:** The current implementation identifies clients based on their IP address (`request.client.host`). This might not be accurate in all cases (e.g., behind proxies). Consider using more sophisticated client identification methods if necessary.
