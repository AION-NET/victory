##   config.py

This file handles the configuration settings for the AION RWX API. It loads environment variables from a `.env` file and defines important constants like the base directory for file operations and the API token. It also includes logic to generate and save an API key if one doesn't exist.

**Code Explanation:**

* **Imports:** It imports the `os` module for operating system interactions, `load_dotenv` and `set_key` from the `dotenv` library for managing environment variables, and `secrets` for secure API key generation.
* **Environment Variable Loading:** `load_dotenv()` loads variables from the `.env` file.
* **`.env` File Path:** `ENV_FILE` stores the name of the environment file.
* **`BASE_DIRECTORY` Definition:** This line determines the base directory for file operations by getting the directory of the current script's absolute path. This ensures that the API primarily interacts within its deployment folder.
* **API Token Loading:** It attempts to load the `API_TOKEN` from the environment variables using `os.getenv()`.
* **`generate_api_key` Function:** This function (identical to the one in `keygen.py`) generates a secure API key using `secrets.token_hex(32)`.
* **`save_api_key` Function:** This function (identical to the one in `keygen.py`) saves the generated API key to the `.env` file.
* **API Key Generation Logic:** Similar to `keygen.py`, if `API_TOKEN` is not found in the environment, a new one is generated and saved. Otherwise, the existing one is loaded.
* **`validate_directory` Function:** This function checks if the `BASE_DIRECTORY` exists. If it doesn't, it raises a `ValueError`. If it exists, it prints a confirmation message.
* **Directory Validation:** The `validate_directory()` function is called to ensure the working directory is set up correctly.
