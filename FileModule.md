##   FileModule.py

This module provides the API endpoints for performing file-related operations within the AION RWX system. It includes functions for creating, reading, deleting, and renaming files, as well as listing files and directories.

**Code Explanation:**

* **Imports:**
    * `os`: For interacting with the operating system (file paths, etc.).
    * `logging`: For logging file operation events and errors.
    * `typing`: For type hinting (Optional).
    * `fastapi`: For defining the API endpoints.
    * `fastapi.responses`: For sending appropriate HTTP responses.
    * `pydantic`: For data validation (BaseModel).
    * `SecurityModule`: Imports security functions (`safe_path`, `verify_api_token`) to ensure secure file access.
* **`setup_file_endpoints(app: FastAPI, base_dir: str)` Function:**
    * This function is crucial for setting up all the file-related API endpoints. It takes the FastAPI application instance (`app`) and the base directory (`base_dir`) as arguments.
    * By organizing the file endpoints within this function, we achieve modularity. This means these endpoints can be easily included or excluded from the main application.
* **`FileOperationResponse` Pydantic Model:**
    * Defines the structure of the JSON response for file operations (create, delete, rename).
    * It includes `status` (e.g., "success", "error") and `message` (a descriptive message).
* **`create_file` Endpoint (`/create_file/` - POST):**
    * Allows creating a new file.
    * **Parameters:**
        * `file_path` (Query): The path for the new file (required).
        * `content` (Body): The initial content of the file (optional).
    * It uses `safe_path` to validate the provided file path.
    * It checks if the file already exists and raises an exception if it does.
    * It creates the file using `open(target_path, "w")`.
    * It logs the file creation.
    * It returns a `FileOperationResponse` with the operation status and message.
* **`delete_file` Endpoint (`/delete_file/` - DELETE):**
    * Allows deleting a specified file.
    * **Parameters:**
        * `file_path` (Query): The path to the file to delete (required).
    * It uses `safe_path` to validate the file path.
    * It checks if the file exists and raises an exception if it doesn't.
    * It deletes the file using `os.remove(target_path)`.
    * It logs the file deletion.
    * It returns a `FileOperationResponse` with the operation status and message.
* **`rename_file` Endpoint (`/rename_file/` - PUT):**
    * Allows renaming a file.
    * **Parameters:**
        * `old_file_path` (Query): The current path of the file (required).
        * `new_file_path` (Query): The new path for the file (required).
    * It uses `safe_path` to validate both the old and new file paths.
    * It checks if the old file exists and the new file path is not already occupied.
    * It renames the file using `os.rename(old_path, new_path)`.
    * It logs the file renaming.
    * It returns a `FileOperationResponse` with the operation status and message.
* **`read_file` Endpoint (`/read/` - GET):**
    * Allows reading the content of a specified file.
    * **Parameters:**
        * `file_path` (Query): The path to the file to read (required).
    * It uses `safe_path` to validate the file path.
    * It checks if the file exists and raises an exception if it doesn't.
    * It reads the file content using `open(target_path, "r")`.
    * It returns the file content in a JSON response.
* **`list_files` Endpoint (`/list/` - GET):**
    * Allows listing files and directories in a specified path.
    * **Parameters:**
        * `path` (Query): The path to list (optional). If not provided, it lists the contents of the base directory.
    * It uses `safe_path` to validate the provided path (if any).
    * It checks if the directory exists and raises an exception if it doesn't.
    * It lists the files and directories using `os.listdir(target_path)`.
    * It returns the list of files in a JSON response.
